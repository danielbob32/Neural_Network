## Personal Progress: Building Neural Network from Scratch
![alt text](image-2.png) 

In this repository, I document my journey of building a neural network from scratch using Python. I aim to understand the fundamental concepts and inner workings of neural networks by implementing them and learning on the way.

### Introduction

In this project, i want to share the progress and also provide an open-source that suitable and clear to enter the world of DL.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── data/                   # Dataset files
├── src/                    # Source code files
│   ├── neural_network.py   # Neural network implementation
│   ├── utils.py            # Utility functions
├── tests/                  # Unit tests
├── README.md               # Project documentation
└── .gitignore              # Git ignore file
```

### Implementation

I have implemented the neural network using Python and have divided the code into separate modules for better organization and reusability. The `neural_network.py` file contains the main implementation of the neural network, while the `utils.py` file includes utility functions for data preprocessing and evaluation.

### Results

I will update this section with the results and performance metrics of the neural network on various datasets. Stay tuned for exciting updates!

### Challenges

I will document these challenges and the solutions I found along the way.

### Future Work

In the future i want to integrate this with existing projects i have to gain more control on the variants and the learning process.
